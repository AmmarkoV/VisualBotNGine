A small project that allows creating bots that can autonomously play desktop games like gweled and score high scores for me , so I can concentrate on more important stuff..


The project is GPL , linux only , and uses XServer as the back end for using the mouse and acquiring the screen information ( xdotool , xwd )   

running scripts/makeRAMfs.sh will create a temp ram filesystem to improve performance when using the fallback xwd screen grabber
